## Prompt 1
Create only the HTML structure for an articles page consisting of a title, a featured article at the top, and two additional articles. Each post should display a title, a metadata list, a short description, and a 'Read More' link. Add a section at the bottom listing 'More Articles'.

## Prompt 2
Apply a clean, minimalistic, modern style to the blog using CSS:
  1. Use neutral or light colors for the background and text
  2. Give the featured article a distinct look so it stands out (e.g.,a light background color, some extra padding).
  3. Ensure both regular posts share consistent spacing and a subtle style that doesnâ€™t overshadow the featured post.
  4. Style the metadata so the items appear on one line with a bit of spacing between them.
  5. Keep headings easy to read and paragraphs well-spaced.
  6. Add a simple, modern font for the whole page.
